data.aggregator.rt
==================

This is the wolf data.aggregator.rt module.

To install:
```
PROJECT_DIR=<your project dir>
cd $PROJECT_DIR
cd wolf
cd data.aggregator.rt
cd bin

nano java.sh and make sure it points to your Java 8 JDK home.

nano install.sh and make sure you are Ok with it.

./install.sh and let the installation run.  Watch for any errors.

Notably, current versions of Cassandra Community version now require
Java 8.  data.aggregator.rt and all other modules have been updated
accordingly.

install.sh will copy a version of java.sh to /etc/profile.d/java.sh so
that the java environment gets set correctly with every boot.  you
may want to reboot your node after ./install.sh completes.

```

To configure:
```
cd /etc/cassandra
sudo /bin/bash
yes, sudo /bin/bash, because if you don't you will forget to
 sudo nano cassandra.yaml and you won't be able to save your changes.
since there are a lot of changes, this can be extremely demoralizing
for you. so, once again, sudo /bin/bash

cd /etc/cassandra
sudo nano cassandra.yaml
